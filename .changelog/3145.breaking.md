go/registry/runtimes: Add AllowedComputeRuntimes to keymanager runtimes

Keymanager runtimes now need to specify compute runtime IDs that are allowed
to use it as a key manager. By default, no runtimes are allowed.

NOTE: Keymanager runtimes exported from existing deployments will default to
not allowing any compute runtimes, so exported state might need to be altered.
