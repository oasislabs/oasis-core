ci: Skip some steps for non-code changes

When one makes a pull request that e.g. only adds documentation or
assembles the Change Log from fragments, all the *heavy* Buildkite
pipeline steps (e.g. Go/Rust building, Go tests, E2E tests) should be
skipped.

Don't rebuild if all I do is add this line.
